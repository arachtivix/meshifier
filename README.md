# Meshifier

A Clojure library for generating and rendering 3D mesh data.

## Installation

Clone this repository and ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Java
- Leiningen
- Blender (for rendering)

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

To use the interactive shape selection mode:

```bash
lein run -i
```

This will:
1. Display a list of available shapes
2. Let you choose a shape to render
3. Generate the selected shape and create renders from multiple angles
4. Save the renders as PNG files in the output directory

Available shapes:
- tetrahedron: A regular tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces
- joined-tetrahedrons: Two tetrahedrons joined by one face
- chair: A simple chair with seat, backrest and four legs

### Direct Rendering

To generate mesh data and save renders directly:

```bash
lein run output/render
```

This will:
1. Generate a chair mesh (default shape)
2. Create renders from multiple angles
3. Save the renders as PNG files (output/render_00.png, output/render_01.png, etc.)

### Output JSON Only

To output the mesh data as JSON without rendering:

```bash
lein run -
```

### Development

Run tests:

```bash
lein test
```

Build an uberjar:

```bash
lein uberjar
```

## Features

  - Regular tetrahedron
  - Joined tetrahedrons
  - Chair
- Render meshes using Blender from multiple angles
- Export mesh data in JSON format
